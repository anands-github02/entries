Task Management Application

A React-based Task Management Application that allows users to create, update, delete, and organize tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. The app integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage, and uses Zustand for state management.

Features

User Authentication:

Sign up, sign in, and log out.

Protected routes for authenticated users.

Task Management:

Create tasks with a title, description, due date, priority, and status.

Update or delete existing tasks.

Drag-and-drop tasks between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).

Filtering and Sorting:

Filter tasks by status and priority.

Sort tasks alphabetically (ascending or descending).

Activity Logs:

Track all user activities (e.g., task creation, updates, deletions).

Responsive Design:

Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used

Frontend:

React

React Router (for routing)

React DnD (for drag-and-drop functionality)

Zustand (for state management)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Backend:

Firebase Authentication (for user authentication)

Firebase Firestore (for database)
